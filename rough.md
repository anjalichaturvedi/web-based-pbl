# Web Based PBL: Rough Idea
Currently, we're making a timetable management system with different functionalities for teachers and students

## Functionalities
Teachers can see:
- Schedule
    - Popup: If hours>11 and <5 
    - Check for clashing
- Room Occupancy 

Students can see:
- Batch-wise schedule with a breakdown of subject codes and classrooms
